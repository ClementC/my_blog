    "Let's start with a track from Joshua Redman that's been living rent-free in my head for years now. It's funky, sophisticated, it's got attitude, it's an instant [stank face](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stank%20face)! I think it was my jazz-band buddy JB who made me listen to the Momentum album, and I've been hooked ever since. I've been lucky to see Joshua Redman a few times over the years in different projects. And below I give you a small drawing of him I made a while ago! üéÅ\n",

    "Then we have a playful and energetic track from The Mauskovic Dance Band. I love writing these small blog posts, because I get to learn a bit about bands I don't know that well. And it turns out that Nicola Mauskovic, the producer and drummer behind this project, is also part of the Turkish psychedelic band Altƒ±n G√ºn, featured in [The Fluke #4](https://clementc.github.io/blog/2021/04/05/the_fluke_4/) :D\n",

    "We go on with a collaboration between producer Kaytranada and jazz band BadBadNotGood, some alternative rock with Cage the Elephant, and quietly end with a dreamy song by Talk Talk, recorded in 1987 in an abandoned church.\n",
