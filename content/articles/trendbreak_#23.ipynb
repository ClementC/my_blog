    "This week, we continue riding the wave of computational tools being used in literature üìäüìö (check out [‚ö°Ô∏èTrendbreak #21‚ö°Ô∏è](https://clementc.github.io/blog/2022/05/23/trendbreak_21/) for a recap). A few years ago, The Atlantic published a [riveting piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/the-six-main-arcs-in-storytelling-identified-by-a-computer/490733/) on harnessing ML and data analysis to quantify and highlight what many authors already knew about \"narrative shapes\" in storytelling. The article draws on American novelist [Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut)'s fierce advocacy of this theory, and the [findings of a study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07772.pdf) that put it to the test with over 1,300 texts from [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/) (a collection of over 60,000 public domain e-books).\n",

    "We've discussed Python's üêç _linters_ (auto-formatting tools) before, but did you know there are similar tools for SQL - often ignored when it comes to stylistic standardization? Meet [SQLfluff](https://www.sqlfluff.com/), a relatively new open-source project that works wonders whether used in command line, as a pre-commit hook, or as a [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dorzey.vscode-sqlfluff). It's well-explained in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@juhanikoskinen/do-not-format-you-sql-manually-a50a5fd0b83f).\n",

    "Ever heard of _online learning_? It's a unique scenario where all the data isn't available at the learning stage, or it changes rapidly over time, demanding models to be learned and updated on-the-go. It's a no-brainer for applications like cybersecurity (fraud detection or intrusion attempts) ü•∑ or large-scale recommendation systems.<br>\n",
    "Max Halford offers a great primer in [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFTmJnIakk) at the GAIA 2022 conference, introducing [RiverML](https://riverml.xyz/), his brainchild and open-source project that rounds up tools with an API similar to scikit-learn.\n",
