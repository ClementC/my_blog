    "For all spaghetti western lovers, this week we've got a track in The Fluke #20 from the album \"Rome\" by Danger Mouse (half of Gnarls Barkley) and Daniele Luppi. Actually there are *two* tracks; I love the interlude version of the song so much that I cheated a bit and included it, making this issue a sixer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Rome\" is a concept album from 2011, described as a \"soundtrack without a movie\", because it draws heavy inspiration from Ennio Morricone's music and is structured to follow a narrative arc, as a film. The [story behind the recording](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/08/dangermouse-norah-jones) in Italy is pretty epic, chasing down vintage instruments and musicians in their 70s for a reunion and bribing them with bottles of red wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "It features Norah Jones and Jack White, and is very much worth a complete listen!\n",
