    "This week we start by taking a bit of interest in Linux. An aspect often difficult to understand when you are used to Windows is the organization of the file system (at least I remember I had a hard time finding my way around it at the time!).\n",

    "Let's continue with a very well done [blog post](https://www.practicalreporting.com/blog/2021/11/14/the-biggest-misconception-in-data-visualization) which explains that there is no \"best choice\" of graph to visualize a particular type of data: according to the author, it is necessary to know what you are trying to illustrate to build a convincing visualization üìä\n",

    "And finally, in the good practices category, here is a [paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007007&type=printable) co-authored among others by [Fernando P√©rez](http://fperez.org/) (creator of IPython and Jupyter, and physicist at UC Berkeley) which lists ten rules for writing notebooks in a more reproducible manner and facilitating collaboration.\n",
