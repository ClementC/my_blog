    "➡️ Taking full advantage of the latest AI coding tools takes a bit of getting used to. This [short article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-programming) offers some pro tips. Just like us humans, these AI tools find it easier to handle problems when they're broken down into bite-sized pieces. Ines Montani, co-creator of the [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) NLP software library, reminds us never to forget the creative side of coding. Meanwhile, other experts stress the importance of understanding the limitations and risks of these tools.\n",

    "➡️ Now, let's hop over to Heidelberg 🇩🇪! At a recent local [PyData](https://pydata.org/) meetup, Gaël Varoquaux (remember him from [⚡️Trendbreak #21⚡️](https://clementc.github.io/blog/2022/05/23/trendbreak_21/)?), research director at INRIA 🇫🇷 and one of the brains behind [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) (that super famous machine learning software library), unveiled his latest open source project, skrub 🧽. It's designed to be the data scientist's wingman, helping out with the vital yet underappreciated task of data prep and clean-up before model training.<br>\n",
    "Skrub is the natural evolution of the ground-breaking work done by the [DirtyData](https://project.inria.fr/dirtydata/) research project in recent years. After acknowledging the hurdles data scientists face in the real-world industry, the project zeroed in on data quality problems, gave birth to robust methodologies, and came up with elegant, effective solutions.<br>\n",
    "I had the good fortune of being part of DirtyData early stages and was blown away by Gaël and his team's razor-sharp vision and insightful reasoning. I strongly urge you to watch the [recorded presentation](https://youtu.be/I4Sksd93bZ4?t=1095) - it's a solid hour of epiphanies and tech wisdom. And hey, [skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/) is growing and on the lookout for contributors 📣!\n",

    "➡️ To wrap things up, we're switching gears to a less techy topic: how will AI photo editing tools shape our individual and collective memories 📸🧠? Jason Kottke asks this thought-provoking question [on his blog](https://kottke.org/23/07/will-ai-change-our-memories), drawing from a video essay by Nerdwriter and the insights of various thinkers and philosophers. If you're not yet familiar with Google's Magic Eraser or Photoshop's new Generative Fill feature, you're in for a wild ride! 🤯\n",
