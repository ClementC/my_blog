    "Let's start the week with some SQL: this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-quick-sql-tips-after-writing-daily-in-sql-for-3-years-37bdba0637d0) from the Towards Data Science blog lists some tips and best practices for writing your queries ü§ì\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to write readable code (in Python üêç this time), automatic formatting tools are very handy: no need to remember all the rules listed in the official style guide ([PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)), just write your code as usual, and then let the tool do all the work to get a clean result! Several tools exist (`autopep8`, `YAPF`...), but `Black` is the one that's been getting a lot of attention recently. It's easy to use, either from the command line, integrated into your favorite IDE, or automatically run as a git pre-commit hook. You can find [here](https://calmcode.io/black/introduction.html) some short videos explaining how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we conclude with a [video by Derek Muller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg) from the Veritasium channel (thanks to my colleague J√©r√¥me for the contribution! üôè), which explains the reasons for a potential return to analog processors, particularly for implementing in hardware the matrix multiplication operations required for neural networks. IBM is already manufacturing [experimental processors](https://web.archive.org/web/20220612043613/https://analog-ai-demo.mybluemix.net/hardware) of this type.\n",
    "The video also provides a brief historical overview of the emergence of this type of algorithms, and the big names in research who have been associated with it.\n",
