    "Privacy protection laws (like GDPR, the French Data Protection Act...) strictly regulate data use, particularly when it comes to analysis or constructing machine learning models. To counter this, a slew of techniques have been developed around _\"synthetic data\"_. The idea is to simulate the behavior of digital doppelgängers 🤖🥸 - realistic enough to maintain statistical relevance, but freeing you from the constraints tied to real individuals.<br>\n",
    "This [article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/11/1026135/ai-synthetic-data/) from MIT Technology Review showcases several companies and use cases tied to \"fake data\", along with points to consider: no surprise, the learned algorithms still hinge on the quality of the input data — a nod to the famous saying [\"Garbage in, garbage out!\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out).\n",

    "If you've so much as glanced at a machine learning tutorial, you've probably heard of the \"Iris\" dataset. It's a set of measurements (petal sizes...) from specimens of three different iris species 🌸. This [brief blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-iris-dataset-a-little-bit-of-history-and-biology-fb4812f5a7b5) traces the creation of this venerable dataset.\n",

    "While machine learning places a premium on prediction problems (where an algorithm, say, correctly labels an image's content or diagnoses an illness — termed as _classification_; or accurately estimates a property's price from its characteristics — what we call _regression_), a significant portion of scientific research is more focused on understanding a phenomenon, often by mathematically modelling it. This is true for physics, climate science, and economics 👨‍🔬🧑‍🔬🌪🏦.<br>\n",
    "This [fascinating Quanta Magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-scientists-distill-the-laws-of-physics-from-raw-data-20220510/) frames the emergence of \"science robots\", capable of distilling natural laws from the examination of quantified observations, as well — if not better — than a physicist might. This type of approach can yield far better results than deep learning models, for example, in producing equations that describe planetary motion 🌞🌗🌎🪐.\n",
