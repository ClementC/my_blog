    "After that we have a beautiful but slightly depressing song by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which is part of the soundtrack of \"Before the Flood\", a 2016 documentary on climate change. The two have worked together on a number of movies now, including \"The Social Network\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\". I really recommend their music for work, when you need to get in the zone.\n",

    "I also want to say a word about E.S. Posthumus, whose track \"Nara\" I included in the playlist. You probably have heard their music before without knowing, because it's been included in _a lot_ of movie trailers, in particular the  2001 \"Unearthed\" album. A (presumably up-to-date) list is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unearthed_%28E.S._Posthumus_album%29#Media_usage) and includes \"Planet of the Apes\", \"Spiderman\", \"Minority Report\" and \"The Two Towers\".\n",
