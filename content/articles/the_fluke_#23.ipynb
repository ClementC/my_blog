    "First we have a song from Micheal League's solo album, \"So Many Me\", released this year. He is a creative genius, most notably as principal composer of the Snarky Puppy band (which I highlighted last week in [The Fluke #22](https://clementc.github.io/blog/2021/10/25/the_fluke_22/)), and also founder of the Forq project ([The Fluke #9](https://clementc.github.io/blog/2021/05/11/the_fluke_9/)). In this song he heavily borrows from moroccan traditional music, using the guembri, a three-stringed acoustic bass, and the qraqebs, iron castagnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have songs from Letta Mbulu, a South African singer active since the 50s, David Walters, a french musician singing in creole, and Jay-Jay Johanson, a Swedish musician and singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We finish with Kazam, a french hip-hop and electro producer, with his song \"Sprezzatura\". I initially listened to it because I really like the [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura), which describes an essential quality for a 16th century italian courtier: studied carelessness, or in other words, giving the impression that everything comes easily, with a certain nonchalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the playlist [here on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7kfaDaViqlhQNjY49bWsDM?si=06dad641085443ea), [here on Deezer](https://deezer.page.link/FdVq1L9qo7aLdBM87), and [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8g99k_gagFQNXibZcS7l-0kmtT36yKnC).\n",
