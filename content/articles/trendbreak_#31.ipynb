    "A fresh podcast has hit the airwaves over the past few weeks and it's packing some serious star power. We're talking top-tier tech titans (Elon Musk, Eric Schmidt, Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg...), machine learning legends (Andrew Ng, Yann LeCun, Fran√ßois Chollet...), artistic achievers, and Nobel notables (Gary Kasparov, Noam Chomsky, Oliver Stone, Paul Krugman...)!<br>\n",
    "If that line-up sounds like a dream come true, well, that's because it kind of is. It's the brainchild of [Johan Nordberg](https://twitter.com/almost_digital), a savvy coder and artist. His mission? To auto-generate podcast episodes ‚Äîzero human meddling allowed‚Äî that run for a few minutes each and echo the style of Lex Fridman's [real podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/). What you get is a polished product that follows a familiar script: catchy intro, meet-the-guest segment, sponsor shout-out, a dash of Q&A, and a snappy sign-off.<br>\n",
    "The real kicker, as Jordan Ellenberg (see [‚ö°Ô∏èTrendbreak #20‚ö°Ô∏è](https://clementc.github.io/blog/2022/05/11/trendbreak_20/)) [points out](https://twitter.com/JSEllenberg/status/1557725935738048513), is the eerily authentic voiceover work. If you're familiar with the person being interviewed (like [Yann LeCun](https://twitter.com/lexman_ai/status/1557653043948158976), for instance), it'll knock your socks off.<br>\n",
    "To pull this off, Nordberg has harnessed the power of cutting-edge data generation algorithms (think GPT-3 for text and Tortoise for the text-to-speech system that nails real-world voices), all choreographed by some smart heuristic wizardry. Curious about his secret sauce? You'll find a full breakdown [right here](https://lexman.rocks/about).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we've got a [thoughtful blog post](https://erikbern.com/2019/01/10/data-architecture-vs-backend-architecture.html) from Erik Bernhardsson (former engineering manager at Spotify üé∂, then CTO of Better.com üèòüíµ), who delves into the architectural differences between backend and data platforms. He explains how divergent constraints can spur entirely opposite design decisions. For instance, integration databases, considered an anti-pattern in backend design, turn out to be the go-to architectural choice for data platforms.\n",

    "Last but certainly not least, we're closing with a [fascinating blog entry](https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-uses-machine-learning-to-make-its-paywall-smarter-e5771d5f46f8) from the tech gurus over at the New York Times. They reveal how they're using causal machine learning techniques to solve a thorny problem: how can they boost the number of paid subscriptions üìà without pulling the plug on free articles that might tempt potential subscribers üì∞?<br>\n",
    "While they don't spill all the beans on the nitty-gritty, they do shed light on the underlying business challenge and toss out a few intriguing concepts and resources worth exploring (predictive vs prescriptive models, _Pareto boundaries_, _inverse probability weighting_, etc.).\n",
