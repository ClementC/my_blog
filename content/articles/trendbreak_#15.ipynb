    "Did you know that the Jupyter ecosystem comes packed with tools that enable you to share your beautiful notebooks in a variety of formats? Whether it's a static web page, interactive visualizations, PDF, or even slides, you've got it all! Check out [this blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/looking-at-notebooks-from-a-new-perspective-bfd06797f188?gi=b3efff81d61f) from the folks at Jupyter for a deep dive into these options, along with specific use cases like presentations, teaching, or sharing with non-technical users.\n",

    "If you're navigating the Python üêç waters, you'll find that while the syntax is rather straightforward, it does come with an array of built-in functions. These cover a wide range of areas - arithmetic, functional programming, data types, iteration tools, you name it! It can be a bit overwhelming, especially when you're just starting out. But don't worry, this [comprehensive blog post](https://treyhunner.com/2019/05/python-builtins-worth-learning/) is a great guide. It categorizes these functions by their importance, complete with code examples. Whether you're a Python newbie or an old hand, there's something to learn for everyone!\n",

    "And for our final treat, here's a dash of [writing wisdom](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02918-5) from [Cormac McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy), the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist known for works like _\"The Road\"_ and _\"No Country for Old Men.\"_ These nuggets were shared by a biologist who had the chance to work with McCarthy at the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary research center where he has been working since 2014. The central takeaway? Always aim for clarity, especially when dealing with technical content. If you're familiar with McCarthy's pared-down prose, this wouldn't come as a surprise!\n",
