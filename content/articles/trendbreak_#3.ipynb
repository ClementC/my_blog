    "When it comes to evaluation metrics, the concepts of sensitivity and specificity are always a bit complicated to grasp properly. Perhaps [this visualization](https://twitter.com/ana_valdi/status/1443334094130225158) with distributions will provide you with a new perspective on the subject.\n",

    "We continue with a [news article from the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58668534) detailing a court ruling made a few weeks ago on the ability for an AI to file patents ðŸ¤–. Verdict in the UK and the US: it's a no-go! However, other countries (Australia, South Africa) have provided a positive answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the main course, I suggest you dive into a [scientific article from Google Research](https://research.google/pubs/pub49953/), both fascinating and very accessible, which presents the concept of _\"data cascades\"_, where data quality issues have a significant negative impact on the performance and usefulness of machine learning models. Don't be intimidated by the number of pages, it reads very well!\n",

    "I wish you good reading and a good week! ðŸ™‚"
