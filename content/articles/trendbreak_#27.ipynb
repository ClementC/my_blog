    "In a short but insightful [blog post](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/p/analysts-are-explorers), Katie Bauer, Data Science Manager at Twitter (see [‚ö°Ô∏èTrendbreak #1‚ö°Ô∏è](https://clementc.github.io/blog/2021/10/07/trendbreak_1/)), draws an interesting parallel between the role of a data analyst and an explorer venturing into uncharted territories. If you're looking for smart takes on data-related issues, definitely give her [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/imightbemary/) a follow.\n",

    "Ever played around with image generation using machine learning? If not, let me introduce you to [Artbreeder](https://collage.artbreeder.com/). It's an intriguing platform that lets you create images using a _\"prompt\"_ (a description of the image content in English) and a _\"collage\"_ (a very simple arrangement of the main shapes). Here are a couple of my recent masterpieces:<br>\n",

    "For several years now, the scientific community has been grappling with the infamous [\"reproducibility crisis\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis). Many fields, from sociology to medical sciences to behavioral psychology, have struggled to independently replicate key research findings, leading to a wave of skepticism even for studies published in prestigious journals.<br>\n",
    "Interestingly, it's not just traditional statistical methods under fire. A [recent Twitter thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/random_walker/status/1547961427498975239) by Princeton professor Arvind Narayanan and his PhD student, Sayash Kapoor, highlights the potential misuse of machine learning techniques across disciplines, including the prediction of civil wars based on socio-economic indicators in political science. They've put together a [workshop](https://sites.google.com/princeton.edu/rep-workshop/) on this topic scheduled for July 28. You can check out a summary of their key findings [here](https://reproducible.cs.princeton.edu/), and for the more academically inclined, their [pre-publication paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07048.pdf) is worth a read.\n",
