    "Everyone has heard of machine learning, but do you know about machine _unlearning_? This [Wired magazine article](https://www.wired.com/story/machines-can-learn-can-they-unlearn) presents this new area of research well.

    "You have probably already encountered this little point of frustration, where your tool is not capable of taking into account exactly the number you want to use (example in the screenshot below in Python). This is due to the numerical representation of real numbers, which is inevitably imperfect.
