    "Ola todos! ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [blog post](https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/10/30/data-dictionaries/) that presents good practices for writing data dictionaries, which are a type of documentation suited for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While advancements in computer hardware performance (predicted by [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)) allow for a regular reduction in computation time, sometimes the software also contributes. [This article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-inch-closer-to-matrix-multiplication-goal-20210323/) describes the quest for a more efficient way to multiply matrices, one of the most common computing operations in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude with [one of my favorite scientific articles](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025912), which shows that simple descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation...) as well as graphical representations that summarize the data (box-and-whisker plots, or boxplots in English) can sometimes hide big differences between several data sets.\n",
    "This is particularly visible on this spectacular animated graph, where a set of continuously modified points will keep the same descriptive statistics to two decimal places!\n",
