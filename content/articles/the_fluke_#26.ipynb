    "Then we have a song from Joe Cuba Sextet. He was an American conga player with a Puerto Rican heritage, and popularized boogaloo music in the fifties and sixties. I find something about the monologue in this song very endearing, a little bit like the famous Giorgio Moroder one on the \"Random Access Memories\" Daft Punk album.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a song by Kokoroko, a recent afrobeat ensemble from London, we have a piece by Arandel, a French DJ with an interesting approach, since he's making electro music using only acoustic instruments. He recently took on reinterpreting some of Bach's most known works, and I think it's really good.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to conclude, we have a version of \"Hard Time Killing Floor Blues\" that I cherish: it's the one on the OST of O'Brother, the Coen brothers' movie, by Chris Thomas King.\n",
